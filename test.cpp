/*
 * std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.
 * Keys are sorted by using the comparison function
 * Compare. Search, removal, and insertion operations have logarithmic complexity.
 * Maps are usually implemented as red-black trees.
 * Redâ€“black tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree.
 * Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black"), used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.
 * When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and "repainted" to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case.
 * The properties are designed such that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.
